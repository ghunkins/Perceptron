Program files: perceptron.py, README.txt 

Running the program:
	(1) Navigate in your terminal to the directory where perceptron.py is stored
	(2) Make sure that the hard-coded dataset is also included in that directory
		i.e. “earthquake-clean.data.txt”
	(2) run the command “python3 perceptron.py”
	(3) the program should run

*****************
YOU MUST USE PYTHON3. PYTHON2 DOES NOT INCLUDE SUPPORT FOR CERTAIN USED PRINT FUNCTIONS. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS, PLEASE CONTACT ME OR REFER TO MY TRACES.

We did not have time for write-up(s). However, the code is fully functional and tested on the “earthquake-clean.data.txt” dataset. It should also run on the other data sets. Every run will result in different graphs and values due to use of Stochastic (random) Gradient Descent.

Test data was fully separated from training data for obvious reasons. Check terminal outputs and graphs for the relevant information on the perceptron’s performance with varying learning rates and linear vs. logarithmic transition functions.
